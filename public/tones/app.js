// them). Only the three JSON files ship same-origin, and this game reads
// the phonics game's copies of them rather than keeping its own: they're
// vendored by sync_dictionary_data.py, and one copy for both games means
// no drift and no change to that script. `../phonics/vocab.json` resolves
// to /phonics/vocab.json from /tones/ - the relative path is deliberate.

// per level (9.8 vs 8.0 for random, 6.1 for themed) and reuse syllables most
// heavily (1.26 syllable tokens per distinct syllable, against 1.14-1.15
// everywhere else), so the player keeps re-tapping the same syllables. This
// game has no syllable bank; it has three tone buttons that are identical on
// every level. With that mechanism gone the category had no rationale left -
// 48 of its 75 words already appear in themed levels and 48 in random, only
// 6 were unique to it, and it carried MORE tonal variety than Random itself.
// It was a longer Random pile under a different name.

// in a generated tone-pattern set; the other five have tone sequences too
// rare to form one (àlùbọ́sà LLHL, olóńgbò MHHL and gọ́ọ̀mù HLL are the only

// Three earlier attempts are recorded here because each one's fix caused the
// next one's problem, and the reasoning is not obvious from the result.
//
// v1: six sine harmonics at 1/n. Pitch-accurate but every tone sounded
// mournful whatever its pitch - six harmonics is a hard ceiling at six times
// the fundamental, about 1.5 kHz for speaker2 and only 833 Hz for speaker3,
// where a real vowel carries energy past 4 kHz. Muffled reads as sad.
//
// v2: a sawtooth through two sharp formant filters. Fixed the dullness, and
// was harsh and angry. Measured, it doubled brightness but nearly doubled
// crest factor (peak over RMS) too, 2.6 -> 4.2.
//
// v3: additive again with a steeper rolloff. Measured *darker* than v1. The
// brightness had been coming from the shallow rolloff all along, so softening
// that threw away the only thing v2 got right.
//
// v4, here. A parameter sweep showed brightness and crest were locked together
// - every setting brighter than v1 was harsher than v1 - which pointed at the
// real culprit: PHASE. Harmonics that all start at zero sum to a spike, and a
// spike is what a sawtooth is. Same spectrum, spread out in time, is far less
// edgy. So instead of stacking oscillators this builds one PeriodicWave, whose
// real/imag pairs set each harmonic's amplitude AND phase, using Schroeder
// phase (-pi*n^2/N), the classic crest-minimising choice. Measured: identical
// brightness at 435 Hz, crest 6.78 -> 3.59.
//
// It is also much cheaper - one oscillator per tone rather than twelve.
//
// Still deliberately untouched: the pitches and contours. Four of the six
// glides fall and the low-to-high span is 325-353 cents, between a minor and a
// major third. That is what was measured from the recordings, and it is why
// these sound plaintive - a fact about Yoruba tone, not a synthesis artifact.
//
// These are the "soft" settings, chosen by ear from a four-way listening
// comparison (current / soft / warm / clear) - see tools/tone-compare, which
// regenerates that comparison if this is ever revisited. Soft measured 306 Hz
// brightness against the old version's 301, so it is not brighter on paper;
// what it fixes is the hard spectral cliff at the 6th harmonic, which is what
// made the old one sound like a voice behind a door. Warm (363 Hz) and clear
